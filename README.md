This repository is archived for manuscript **"The cybernetic approach to modeling dynamic regulation of nitrogen biogeochemical transformations 
".** Four case studies are included: 


* Dual substrate competition between Denitrification and DNRA

* Electron competition among different denitrification steps

* Coupled nitrification-denitrification dynamics

* A full model of N transformations, including OM mineralization (releasing Ammonium), aerobic respiration, nitrification, denitrification, DNRA and Anammox
