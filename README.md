This repository is archived for manuscript **"A cybernetic approach for modeling dynamic nitrogen biogeochemical transformations".** There major modeling components are included: 

* Dual substrate competition between Denitrification and DNRA

* Electron competition among different denitrification steps

* A full model of N transformations, including OM mineralization (releasing Ammonium), aerobic respiration, nitrification, denitrification, DNRA and Anammox
